# Nare


Nare is a early stage game engine that I plan to mainly develop for Windows, but also plan to develop for other platforms in the future. It will be able to support multiple render APIs. Not much is implemented of the current state.

# Getting started

Only tried on Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio 2022.

For now, only build in Debug x86 is possible.
